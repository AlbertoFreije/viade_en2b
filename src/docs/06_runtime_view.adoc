=== Sharing a route

The users are capable of sharing a route that has been previously added with their friends. In order to do it, they will just select the route that should be shared and the system will get it from the user's POD. Afterwards, Viade will notificate the user about the state of the sharing process, indicating whether there's been an error or not.
