== Runtime View

In this section of the documentation important use cases will be described in order to understand how the system communicates at runtime.

This part of the documentation will be in continuous development.

=== Login into the application

Users can access the functionalities of the application logging in with their Solid account.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
MainPage -> LoginPage : <<user clicks in LOG IN button>>
create collections SolidLoginPopUp
LoginPage --> SolidLoginPopUp : <<user opens Solid pop-up>>
LoginPage <-- SolidLoginPopUp : <<user logged in>>
....

=== Adding a route

The user will be able to add new routes. The data belonging to that specific route will be stored in their own particular pod.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
MapContainer -> AddRoute
AddRoute -> RouteCache : addRoute(route)
RouteCache -> RouteGateway : addRoute(route)
RouteCache --> RouteCache : <<cache route>>
RouteGateway -> AddUserRoute : addRoute(route)
AddUserRoute --> : <<save in POD>>
....

=== Recording a route

Once a user presses the button to start recording, they can move and their movement will be tracked; when they press the button again to stop the recording and name the recorded route, it will inmediately saved in the cache and sent to the POD.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
MapContainer -> RecordRoute
RecordRoute -> RouteCache : recordRoute(route)
RouteCache --> RouteCache : <<cache route>>
RouteCache -> RouteGateway : addRoute(route)
RouteGateway -> AddUserRoute : addRoute(route)
AddUserRoute --> : <<save in POD>>
....

=== Sharing a route

The users are capable of sharing a route that has been previously added with their friends. In order to do it, they will just select the route that should be shared and the system will get it from the user's POD. Afterwards, Viade will notificate the user about the state of the sharing process, indicating whether there's been an error or not.


[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
RoutesList -> RoutesCache :  setSelected(route)
RoutesList -> RoutesList : <<selects share button and selects user>>
RoutesList -> ShareRoute : ShareWith(user,loggedUser,shareWithUser) 
ShareWith -> : << shares routes, sets permissions and generates notification >>
ShareRoute -> RoutesList : return created
....

=== Adding a friend

In our application, users have the possibility to add other users as friends, and so, be able to share routes with them.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
FriendList -> FriendCache : addFriend(webId)
FriendCache -> AddFriend : AddFriend(webId)
AddFriend -> : <<add friend in POD>>
....

=== Deleting a friend

In our application, users also have the possibility to delete friends.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
FriendList -> FriendCache : deleteFriend(webId)
FriendCache -> DeleteFriend : DeleteFriend(webId)
DeleteFriend -> : <<delete friend in POD>>
....

=== See created routes

The user can see the routes that they have in their POD, and can interact with those routes' data in various ways.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
participant MainPage order 1
participant RoutesPage order 2
participant RouteCache order 3
participant FileCache order 4
participant RouteGateway order 5
participant ListUserRoutes order 6

MainPage -> RoutesPage
RoutesPage --> RoutesPage : <<loading view>>
RoutesPage -> RouteCache : getRoutes()
RouteCache -> RouteGateway : findAll()
RouteGateway -> ListUserRoutes : loadUserRoutesFiles()
ListUserRoutes <-- : <<get routes from the POD>>
ListUserRoutes -> RouteGateway : return Object(routes, filePaths)
RouteGateway -> RouteCache : return Object(routes, filePaths)
RouteCache --> RouteCache : <<cache routes>>
RouteCache -> FileCache : addFilePaths(filePaths)
....

=== Link to a route an uploaded file

Users can upload a file from their device (image or video) and automatically link it to a selected route.

[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
participant RoutesPage order 1
participant MainPage order 2
participant Dropzone order 3
participant RouteCache order 4
participant FileCache order 5
participant FileGateway order 6
participant FileUpload order 7
participant FileLink order 8

RoutesPage -> RouteCache : setSelected(route)
RoutesPage -> MainPage
MainPage <- RouteCache : getSelected()
MainPage -> Dropzone : <<user clicks on upload button>>
Dropzone --> Dropzone : <<user adds files to upload>>
Dropzone -> FileCache : uploadFiles(routeSelected, files)
FileCache -> FileGateway : uploadFiles(routeSelected, files)
FileGateway -> FileUpload : uploadFiles(files)
FileUpload --> : <<save files in POD>>
FileUpload -> FileGateway : return filePaths
FileGateway -> FileLink : linkFilesToRoute(routeSelected, filePaths)
FileLink <-- : <<get route from POD>>
FileLink --> : <<save updated route to POD>>
FileLink -> FileGateway
FileGateway -> FileCache : return filePaths
FileCache --> FileCache : <<cache filePaths>>
....

=== Commenting a route
Users can leave comments in their own routes or routes that other users have shared with them.
[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
participant MainPage order 1
participant RoutesPage order 2
participant CommentsPage order 3
participant RouteGateway order 4
participant CommentsGateway order 5
participant GetComments order 6
participant AddComment order 7

RoutesPage -> RouteCache : setSelected(route)
RoutesPage -> MainPage
MainPage <- RouteCache : getSelected()
MainPage -> CommentsPage : <<user writes comment>>
CommentsPage --> CommentsPage : <<user presses submit comment>>
CommentsPage -> CommentsGateway : postComment(routeCommentsUrl, comment)
CommentsGateway -> GetComments : getComments(routeCommentsUrl)
GetComments -> CommentsGateway : return comments
CommentsGateway --> CommentsGateway : <<new comment is added to found comments>>
CommentsGateway -> AddComment : addComment(routeCommentsUrl,comments)
AddComment -> CommentsGateway : return added
....

=== Receiving a notification
Users receive notifications when an user posts a comment in one of their routes or a route is shared with them.
[plantuml, diagram-sequence, png]
....
NotificationPage -> NotificationManager : getNotificationDocuments(inboxPath,webId)
NotificationManager --> NotificationPage : return notifications
....
