== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Technical constraints

[options="header",cols="1,2"]

|Constraint|Explanation
| Solid | The application must follow the link:https://github.com/solid/solid-spec[Solid specifications] and make use of Solid pods, as well as being decentralized and follow linked data principles.
| React framework | React is the framework that will be used to implement the application. The architecture of the application has to be adapted to the inner workings of the Javascript library (components, routing, rendering...).
| Interoperability between similar webapps | The design for the data saving and retrieving has to be thoughtfully taken care of such that a user can switch between similar apps without having to modify their data (using of Solid, W3C standards, etc.).
| Test-Driven Development | Any functionality added must be constantly and thoroughly tested by the development team, making use of the testing tools available (Cucumber, Travis, Codecov).
| Documentation | The project's architecture must be documented in AsciiDoc format following the arc42 templates.
