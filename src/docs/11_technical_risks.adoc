In the development of this project we are facing the following risks and technical debts that may affect our work.

|===

|Risk / Technical debts | Measures we are taking 
|The team is not familiar with Solid| We will be researching about it using all the resources available at the official webpage and repositories
|The team is not familiar with React framework|We will be researching about it to be familiar with all of its capabilities that fit the most in our project
|No experience working in a team this big| We will be working on using Git properly to get the most out of it and keep an open conversation to divide the work in the best way possible
|Little experience with JavaScript| We will try to work on our own to get familiar with the language
|Coordinating with other teams to reach an standard| We should be working with other teams to agree on using an standard for the routes to provide interoperability
