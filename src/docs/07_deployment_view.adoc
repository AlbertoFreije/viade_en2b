== Deployment View

The deployment is fairly simple, as our application was designed as a web app. When accessing the web page via any modern browser, be it desktop or phone, the react app with our code gets loaded into memory, and checks if you are already logged onto any SOLID service. If you are, your data will automatically be downloaded from that server using HTTP GET requests to your profile URI.

When in the main page, the app also asks the Google Maps API for a map to display to the user, customized to our own style. When the user makes any modification to their data, an HTTP POST request is sent to the appropriate pod. For example, when sharing a route, the appropriate POST request is done to the destination pod, different from the users (and possibly in a different server).
