== System Scope and Context
The system scope and responsibilities define what the system should do in order to fulfill its objective. Viade should have the following features:


* The system should be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app.
* Enable users to store their routes in their own pods
* Enable users to view the routes stored on a map
* Enable users to share pictures, videos or information about a route with other friends
* Enable the user to receive notifications when other friends share a route with him.
* Enable the users to for groups of friends with whom the may want to share routes
* Enable the users to view routes loaded by users that are using a different app.


=== Business Context

Due to the requirement that states that the decentralized application must implement SOLID technology, each user of the system will have a POD where its data will be stored. The application will establish a communication with the user's POD to read/write the required data from it. 

* Communication elements:

** User: represents the end user of the application.
** Viade: the application itself, in charge of managing the access to the data. Uses an authentication protocol to perform the user data access, and links that point to the user pod.
which contains application data
** POD: web-accessible personal datastore of each user.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
