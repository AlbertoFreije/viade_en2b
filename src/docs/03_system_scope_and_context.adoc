== System Scope and Context

The main goal of this project is to create a decentralized routes management system based on Solid, which means that
every user has its own Pod, that is their own personal storage space, where all of their information is stored.
The main communication partners of the applications will be the users themselves.

Viade should have the following features:

* The system should be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app.
* Enable users to store their routes in their own pods
* Enable users to view the routes stored on a map
* Enable users to share pictures, videos or information about a route with other friends
* Enable the user to receive notifications when other friends share a route with him.
* Enable the users to for groups of friends with whom the may want to share routes
* Enable the users to view routes loaded by users that are using a different app.


=== Business Context

Due to the requirement that states that the decentralized application must implement SOLID technology, each user of the system will have a POD where its data will be stored. The application will establish a communication with the user's POD to read/write the required data from it. 

* Communication elements:

** User: represents the end user of the application.
** Viade: the application itself, in charge of managing the access to the data. Uses an authentication protocol to perform the user data access, and links that point to the user pod.
which contains application data
** POD: web-accessible personal datastore of each user.

=== Technical Context

The application, although in its core a web application, is expected to work in all types of devices. In order to make it decentralized all user's data will be saved in each user's own Solid Pod.

* Technical interfaces:
** Solid
** Javascript
** React navite
** Map api
