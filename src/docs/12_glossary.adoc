| Test-driven development (TDD) | Type of development that consists in writing the tests while or even the code to be tested that adds any functionality. Tests are normally combined into _units_, which contain one or more tests related to a certain functionality.
| Behaviour-driven development (BDD) | Derived from TDD, this type of development takes TDD's unit testing and wraps it around and explicit explained of the scenario(s) being tested (similar to user stories), thus asserting the correct behaviour of different use cases.
